# Coverage Tests

## Hypervisor Coverage Tests

The hypervisor coverage tests are targeted checks for the currently implemented
parts of Wally's RISC-V Hypervisor extension support. They are intended to run
on `rv64gch` against ImperasDV lockstep.

These are not full H-extension architectural compliance tests. In particular,
the checked-in tests do not yet cover non-Bare two-stage translation, full guest
page-fault plumbing, or stable VS/VU normal execution.

<details>
<summary>Common build and ImperasDV setup</summary>

Build an individual test from the repository root:

```sh
source ./setup.sh
make -C tests/coverage <test>.elf <test>.elf.objdump
```

Run an individual test with ImperasDV lockstep:

```sh
wsim rv64gch --elf tests/coverage/<test>.elf --lockstepverbose > <test>.log 2>&1
```

A successful lockstep run should report:

```text
Mismatches            : 0
```

The test should write `tohost = 1`, then stop at the normal coverage-test self
loop / testbench stop point. If a self-check fails, these tests write
`tohost = 3` with a store word so the testbench terminates instead of repeatedly
writing `tohost`.

The `rv64gch` ImperasDV run needs a local configuration file at:

```text
config/deriv/rv64gch/imperas.ic
```

`config/deriv` is ignored by git, so first generate the derived configurations
from the repository root:

```sh
make deriv
```

Then create the local Imperas config if needed. Copy and paste the contents of
`config/rv64gc/imperas.ic` into `config/deriv/rv64gch/imperas.ic`, then make
these edits:

1. Change the variant line from `--variant RV64GCK` to `--variant RV64GCH`.
2. Add `--override cpu/GEILEN=1`.
3. Remove the crypto override block, because this target is `GCH`, not `GCK`:

```text
# Crypto extensions
--override cpu/Zkr=F
--override cpu/Zksed=F
--override cpu/Zksh=F
--override cpu/mnoise_undefined=T
```

If the destination directory or file does not exist yet, create it first:

```sh
mkdir -p config/deriv/rv64gch
touch config/deriv/rv64gch/imperas.ic
```

Then paste in the contents from `config/rv64gc/imperas.ic` and make the edits
above.

<summary>hypervisorUnitTests.S</summary>

`hypervisorUnitTests.S` is a broad unit test for implemented H-extension CSR,
aliasing, interrupt CSR, and privileged decode behavior.

What it tests:

- Hypervisor CSR read/write and WARL behavior from M-mode:
  - `mtinst`, `mtval2`
  - `hstatus`, `hedeleg`, `mideleg`, `hideleg`, `hcounteren`, `hgeie`
  - `htval`, `htinst`, `hgatp`
  - `vsstatus`, `vstvec`, `vsscratch`, `vsepc`, `vscause`, `vstval`, `vsatp`
- Hypervisor interrupt CSR aliasing:
  - GEILEN=1 behavior for `hstatus.VGEIN`, `hgeie`, and `mideleg`.SGEI
  - `hie` writes reflected in `mie`
  - `vsie` writes reflected through delegated `hie`/`mie` bits
  - `hip`, `hvip`, and `vsip` delegated virtual interrupt aliases
- Timer and environment CSRs:
  - `vstimecmp`
  - `menvcfg` / `henvcfg`
  - `htimedelta`
- Read-only / illegal CSR behavior:
  - `hgeip` write attempts trap as illegal; pending state is driven by the
    test MMIO source
- HS-mode execution:
  - enters HS using the shared `WALLY-init-lib.h` ecall privilege-change helper
  - executes `hfence.gvma x0, x0` in HS
  - drives guest external interrupt 1 through the local TrickBox HGEIP source
    and checks HS-level SGEI delivery
  - returns to M-mode and verifies a marker register to confirm the HS block ran
- Hypervisor privileged instruction decode:
  - legal `hfence.vvma x0, x0` in M-mode
  - legal `hfence.gvma x0, x0` in M-mode
  - illegal HFENCE-like encoding with nonzero `rd`, expecting `mcause = 2`

Known limitations:

- VS/VU execution is not included yet. Earlier experiments could enter
  virtualized state but were not stable enough for this coverage test because
  guest execution, trap behavior, and two-stage translation support are still
  incomplete.
- The test is primarily for implemented CSR behavior, RVVI/Imperas lockstep
  visibility, and privileged decode coverage.

Build:

```sh
source ./setup.sh
make -C tests/coverage hypervisorUnitTests.elf hypervisorUnitTests.elf.objdump
```

Run:

```sh
wsim rv64gch --elf tests/coverage/hypervisorUnitTests.elf --lockstepverbose > hypervisorUnitTests.log 2>&1
```

Useful generated files:

- `tests/coverage/hypervisorUnitTests.elf`
- `tests/coverage/hypervisorUnitTests.elf.objdump`
- `tests/coverage/hypervisorUnitTests.elf.memfile`

The guest-external interrupt check uses the CLINT-range TrickBox sidecar:
`TRICKEN[6]` is written at `0x0200A010`, then HGEIP bit 1 is driven through the
slot at `0x0200C000`.

In `--lockstepverbose` output, the HS-mode test can be identified by the
instruction trace around `hs_mode_entry`, where Imperas prints the privilege
label as `Supervisor`:

```text
0x000000008000545a(hs_mode_entry): Supervisor ...
0x000000008000545e(hs_mode_entry+4): Supervisor 62000073 hfence.gvma x0,x0
```

In this test context, `Supervisor` with virtualization mode `V=0` corresponds
to HS-mode.

<summary>hypervisorInterrupts.S</summary>

`hypervisorInterrupts.S` is a focused companion test for implemented
H-extension interrupt behavior.

What it tests:

- `GEILEN=1` interrupt-visible CSR behavior for `hstatus.VGEIN`, `hgeie`, and
  read-only-one `mideleg`.SGEI
- `hie` / `mie` aliasing for SGEIE and VS interrupt-enable bits
- `vsie` delegated interrupt-enable aliasing
- `hip`, `hvip`, and `vsip` delegated virtual interrupt-pending aliases
- read-only `hgeip` CSR behavior
- HS-mode delivery of software-injected VSSI, VSTI, and VSEI through `hvip`
- HS-mode supervisor guest external interrupt delivery through the local
  TrickBox HGEIP source

Build:

```sh
source ./setup.sh
make -C tests/coverage hypervisorInterrupts.elf hypervisorInterrupts.elf.objdump
```

Run:

```sh
wsim rv64gch --elf tests/coverage/hypervisorInterrupts.elf --lockstepverbose > hypervisorInterrupts.log 2>&1
```

The same local ImperasDV `GEILEN=1` override and HGEIP TrickBox addresses
described for `hypervisorUnitTests.S` apply to this test.

<summary>hypervisorExceptions.S</summary>

`hypervisorExceptions.S` is a focused companion test for hypervisor exception
classification and trap CSR side effects.

What it tests:

- VS-mode virtual-instruction traps for H CSR access, HFENCE, HLV,
  CBO/envcfg, SATP under `hstatus.VTVM`, and SRET under `hstatus.VTSR`
- `mtval` contents for those virtual-instruction traps
- HS-mode illegal-instruction delegation for `hfence.gvma` when
  `mstatus.TVM=1`
- `stval` contents for the delegated HS illegal-instruction trap

Build:

```sh
source ./setup.sh
make -C tests/coverage hypervisorExceptions.elf hypervisorExceptions.elf.objdump
```

Run:

```sh
wsim rv64gch --elf tests/coverage/hypervisorExceptions.elf --lockstepverbose > hypervisorExceptions.log 2>&1
```

<details>
<summary>hypervisorLoadStore.S</summary>

`hypervisorLoadStore.S` is a focused test for the implemented HLV, HLVX, and
HSV execution path with both VS-stage and G-stage translation set to Bare. This
matches the current first-pass RTL support for HLV/HLVX/HSV and intentionally
avoids non-Bare guest translation behavior.

Setup:

- Clears `satp`, `vsatp`, and `hgatp`, so ordinary, VS-stage, and G-stage
  translation are Bare.
- Sets `hstatus.SPVP=1`, so HLV/HLVX/HSV use VS-level effective privilege.
- Uses hand-encoded `.word` macros for HLV/HLVX/HSV so the test does not depend
  on assembler mnemonic support.

What it tests:

- M-mode HLV and HLVX loads from one test doubleword:
  - `hlv.b`
  - `hlv.bu`
  - `hlv.h`
  - `hlv.hu`
  - `hlv.w`
  - `hlv.wu`
  - `hlv.d`
  - `hlvx.hu`
  - `hlvx.wu`
- M-mode HSV stores and ordinary load readback:
  - `hsv.b`
  - `hsv.h`
  - `hsv.w`
  - `hsv.d`
- U-mode HLV/HSV execution when `hstatus.HU=1`:
  - enters U-mode with the shared privilege-change helper
  - executes `hlv.bu`
  - executes `hsv.b`
  - returns to M-mode and verifies the U-mode store updated memory

Known limitations:

- Non-Bare VS-stage and G-stage translation are not covered.
- Guest-page-fault behavior and guest physical address reporting through
  `mtval2` / `htval` are not covered.
- `htinst` / `mtinst` trap transform behavior is not covered.
- HLVX execute-permission behavior through page tables and PMP is not covered.
- MPRV/MPV interactions for ordinary load/store instructions are not covered.

Build:

```sh
source ./setup.sh
make -C tests/coverage hypervisorLoadStore.elf hypervisorLoadStore.elf.objdump
```

Run:

```sh
wsim rv64gch --elf tests/coverage/hypervisorLoadStore.elf --lockstepverbose > hypervisorLoadStore.log 2>&1
```

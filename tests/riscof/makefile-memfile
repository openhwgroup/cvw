# notes to self on how this works.
# The find command locates all of the *.elf files in directory DIR1.  A list of .memfiles and
# .addr files are generated from the .elf.  These are used as targets.
# % is a wildcard in a make target which is then referenced as % in the depenecies and $*
# in the recipe.
# because elf2hex requires a bit width we use findstring to figure out if the compiled directory
# is XLEN=64 or 32. This is hacky and will likely break in the future.
# the .addr is a separate target so make can split into more jobs and more parallelism.

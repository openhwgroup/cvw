verilog-ethernet contains many ethernet devices.  Wally's synthesizable RVVI interface only requires a small subset of these files.
To do a sparse checkout of this repo copy sparse-checkout to cvw/.git/modules/addins/verilog-ethernet/info
This will make the working directory only contain the necessary files.

This directory has several items that help with understanding the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA).  It includes the following:

1.) Python programs for both SHA-256 and SHA-512
2.) Simplified implementations in SystemVerilog for SHA-256 and SHA-512
3.) DO files for the SystemVerilog files to run with Questa
